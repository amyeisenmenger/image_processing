---------- CS6640: IMAGE PROCESSING ASSIGNMENT 2 ----------

----- RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS -----

main.m will run all functions and save output images or graphs when applicable.
Some figures may pop up before closing on their own.
The labeled graph of the Hough transform matrix will save in the main folder rather than output
and I cannot figure out how to set permissions otherwise.

The running order is:

GaussianFilter
BilateralFilter
MSE
Gradient 
Hough Transform


The file will take approximately 10 seconds to run all the functions.
